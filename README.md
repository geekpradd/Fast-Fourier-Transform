###Fast Fourier Transform C++ Implementation

The following code (mainly ntt.cpp) implements Number Theoretic Transform in C++ for multiplying two polynomials in O(nlogn)
This was motivated to solve the question https://www.codechef.com/DEC19A/problems/BINOFEV/ and so I learnt how to use FFT and NTT
Code can be optimised more but passes the required subtask
Solution to the problem in various forms is also uploaded (naive, with vector, and with array).
